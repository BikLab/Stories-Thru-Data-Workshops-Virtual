# "Telling Stories Through Data" - Virtual Workshops (2026 and 2027)

### Next Workshop Series: January 20 - Februay 26, 2026
### Location: Virtual (Zoom) sessions, 
### Schedule: Two 1.5 hour Zoom sessions per week, Tuesdays and Thursdays 3pm - 4:30pm US Eastern Time (New York City time zone)

Applications to participate will close on **Saturday January 10th**, and selected participants will be notified of acceptance the following week (week of January 12th). Due to space and funding constraints, this year's workshop will be capped at 20 participants. This virutal workshop is FREE for all selected participants. 

This workshop is targeted towards **graduate students** and **postdoctoral researchers**, although we will consider applications from other early-career scientists who would especially benefit from participating. All participants are expected to have some basic familiarity with command line tools and scientific programming (e.g. Unix, R, and/or Python) in order to fully benefit from the workshop trainings. This is NOT an introductory programming course; we will focusing on running -Omics workflows and downstream data visualizations of target datasets. 

Any questions about this workshop should be directed to Holly Bik at UGA (lead organizer and NSF grant PI) - [hbik@uga.edu](mailto:hbik@uga.edu)
